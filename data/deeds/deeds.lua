The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair.

At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common. The dwarves often settled for building powerful strongholds designed to make the approach to their cities, impervious to assault, manning them with skilled and powerful guardians to ensure that none would pass unchallenged.While the book itself is common enough, the owner of this copy seems to have scribbled copious notes within the margins of the pages -- notes containing an experience and insight to the art that even at a glance exceeds that of the original author.

It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind.

You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past.

It is no simple treatise on the art of battle, as so many texts are. Rather, it is a philosophical tract that describes the author's outlook upon warfare and battle, and how he came eventually to seek it out as a meditative and even transcendant experience that he was unable to experience in any other setting save the midst of clashing blades and the cries of battle. It is not a text for the faint-hearted or the meek, but it seems oddly lofty and its tone does not reflect the maddened bloodlust that one might have expected given the title.Alas, the long years have been rough on your copy, and there are a number of pages torn or missing from it.
