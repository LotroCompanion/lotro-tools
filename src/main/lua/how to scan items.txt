Items scanning:
1) Install the plugin into the directory:
C:\Users\XXX\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\GaluhadPlugins\ItemTreasury

2) Start & configure game
Unload all plugins
Configure a new tab for console and use select only "Standard" in the filters

3) Scan session:
- Start logging in the new tab
- load plugin "Item Treasury"
- type /ItemDump N
Where N is the ID of the first item to scan.
The plugin will scan items N to N+100000. It will finish gracefully or it will crash the game client.
The log file is available in:
C:\Users\XXX\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\<TabName>_<Date>_<Index>.txt

Repeat scan sessions until all items are scanned.

4) Build the LUA file:
Merge all console logs into one file.
Add a line with "{" at the beginning of file.
Add a line with "};" at the end of file.

5) Use this file as input for the TulkasItemsDBParser (INDEX version).
