Items scanning:
1) Install the plugin into the directory:
C:\Users\XXX\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\GaluhadPlugins\ItemTreasury

2) Setup the range of items to scan:
In file, Utils\GeneralFunctions.lua look for lines like:

Turbine.Shell.WriteLine(GetItemFromID(1879230113):GetItemInfo():GetName()); -- Crumpet
-- 19.2.2: 1879049233->1879342508
--GetAllItemFromID(1879049233,1879049233+50000);

If line is commented, no scan is performed on plugin startup.

3) Start & configure game
Unload all plugins
Configure a new tab for console and use select only "Standard" in the filters

4) Scan session:
- update the lua file to setup the scan range
- Start logging in the new tab
- load plugin "Item Treasury"

The plugin will start and the game will scan all specified items, until it finishes the range, or it crashes.
The log file is available in:
C:\Users\XXX\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\<TabName>_<Date>_<Index>.txt

Repeat scan sessions until all items are scanned.

5) Build the LUA file:
Merge all console logs into one file.
Add a line with "{" at the beginning of file.
Add a line with "};" at the end of file.

6) Use this file as input for the TulkasItemsDBParser (INDEX version).
